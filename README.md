# SOCNN
This is the unofficial code for [Autoregressive Convolutional Neural Networks for Asynchronous Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04122). 

# Requirements
You can get python packages.  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# household_power_consumption
You can use household_power_consumption datasets. When you train and test the model,  
`python train_socnn_with_household.py`
