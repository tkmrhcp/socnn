# SOCNN
This is the unofficial code for [Autoregressive Convolutional Neural Networks for Asynchronous Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04122). 

You can build Significance-Offset Convolutional Neural Network (SOCNN) by 


## Requirements
You can get python packages.  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# household_power_consumption
You can use household_power_consumption datasets.  
When you train and test the model,  
`python train_socnn_with_household.py`  
household_power_consumption.txt in this repository is smaller than real datasets.  
you can douwnload real datasets from <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00235/household_power_consumption.zip>
